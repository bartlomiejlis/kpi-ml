Company turnover percentage forecast using ARMA, ARIMA and SARIMAX models.

The aim of the project is to train a model to predict the percentage of the company's turnover. The company's turnover percentage is the ratio of subcontractors' costs to the company's net turnover expressed as a percentage.

Three time series models were selected for the project: ARMA, ARIMA and SARIMAX, due to the sequential nature of the data.

The data is located in an Excel file whose sheets have been divided into individual months.
